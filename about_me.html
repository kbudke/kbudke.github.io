<p class="pink-text"> She's a truck-driving magic mama! Men watch the action movie, they eat of the beef, and enjoy to look at the bosoms. Easy as really difficult pie. It's getting eerie, what's this cheery singing all about? I swallowed a bug. Don't be ridiculous. Martha Stewart isn't a demon. She's a witch. You're really campaigning for bitch-of-the-year, aren't you? We're pimps and killers, but in a philanthropic way. It's funny how the Earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to. </p>
<p> Let me pour you a big frosty mug of 'shut-the-hell-up.' I saw their production of 'Giselle' in 1890. I wept like a baby, and I was evil! </p>
<p class="blue-text"> I, Anya, promise to love you, to cherish you, to honor you, but not to obey you, of course, because that's anachronistic and misogynistic and who do you think you are, like a sea captain or something? What gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover again? Well we could grind our enemies into talcum powder with a sledgehammer but, gosh, we did that last night. Military people don't make out with science people. These are stone killers, little man. They ain't cuddly like me. Your futures are murky; you'd do well to heed my...I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I? No need, little lady, your tears of gratitude are enough for me. It's just a long cultural tradition of raging insincerity. </p>
<p> I gave birth to a pterodactyl. You're lesbians, so the hating of men will come in handy. What, you think this isn't real just because of all the vampires, and demons, and ex-vengeance demons, and the sister that used to be a big ball of universe-destroying energy? They rampaged through half the known world until Angel got his soul. I, Anya, promise to love you, to cherish you, to honor you, but not to obey you, of course, because that's anachronistic and misogynistic and who do you think you are, like a sea captain or something? Ain't it crazy how slaying just always makes you hungry and horny? You're gonna die screaming but you won't be heard. Planet's coming up a mite fast. They are come to the killing floor. </p>

<h2>Another section just for me!!!</h2>

<p> So I skipped intro to evil or whatever, but how is it that I get an F, when this guy that we're reading, Chauncey, can't even spell? With any luck, he'll poke the wrong one and end up in an alternative dimension inhabited by a fifty-foot Giles that squishes annoying teeny pirates. Let me pour you a big frosty mug of 'shut-the-hell-up.' I mean, officially I deplore violence, but that was totally worth the loss of karma points! Little man loved fire. </p>
<p> Well, excuse me, Mr. I-spent-the-sixties-in-an-electric-Kool-Aid-funky-Satan-groove! Welcome to the nancy tribe. You're really campaigning for bitch-of-the-year, aren't you? Who's calling me? Everybody I know lives here. With any luck, he'll poke the wrong one and end up in an alternative dimension inhabited by a fifty-foot Giles that squishes annoying teeny pirates. You're the Slayer, and we're, like, the Slayerettes! They need to take seven and they might take yours. </p>
