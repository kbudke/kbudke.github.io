Me with my beautiful love!

<p> But I haven't spent any money! I was all... dead and frugal. We're pimps and killers, but in a philanthropic way.  </p>
<p> You haven't seen my drawer of inappropriate starches? See, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like. I find it a bit sad that you think of yourself as a candidate for anyone's fantasy. Winning over your enemy, the one person guaranteed to reject everything you are, that's real love. The gentlemen are coming by. What do they need such good eyesight for anyway? They're a little bit bison. </p>
<p> We will rule over all this land, and we will call it...This Land. Oh Spike, devour me! </p>

<h2>This would be a secondary section.</h2>

<p class="pink-text"> The human body can be drained of blood in 8.6 seconds given adequate vacuuming systems. Spike follows the exciting smell of blood and we follow the fairly ripe smell of Spike. We'll have to call it early quantum state phenomenon. Only way to fit 5000 species of mammal on the same boat. </p>
<p class="blue-text"> You're lesbians, so the hating of men will come in handy. Someone else's loss is my chocolatey goodness. This distress call wouldn't be taking place in someone's pants, would it? Love keeps her in the air when she ought to fall down. </p>
